# burger

This app utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.

In this app, the user chooses a burger and/or a side and eats it by clicking the "Devour It!" button.  Once it's eaten, the user can delete it by clicking the "YUM" button.  

The database updates the menu with the ordered/eaten items.
